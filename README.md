Flashcards are one of the best methods for learning, especially when using advanced flashcard apps like Quizlet and Anki. Creating a 
flashcard deck yourself, however, is a tedious and time-consuming task which reduces productivity and learning effectiveness.
Moreover, once all the flashcards are learned they become useless.

Using ready flashcards from the internet generally doesnâ€™t do the job either since they usually differ in content, even if the topic is
the same.
