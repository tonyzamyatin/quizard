Recognition characteristics of cancer
Cancers are characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and division. There are certain hallmarks of cancer that are very common in many types of
cancer. Cancer cells must not only continue to divide, but also find ways to prevent death. When cells accumulate large amounts of DNA damage, they
usually undergo programmed cell death, known as apoptosis. Another barrier is the immune system, which is constantly on the hunt for cancer and kills
cells with certain DNA damage. Some of the most common cancer mutations (such as p53) therefore prevent apoptosis or help evade the immune system.
Genome instability is another hallmark of cancer. A combination of just a handful of specific mutations is sufficient to initiate cancer. However,
enough mutations must first accumulate to hit these highly carcinogenic oncogenes and tumor suppressors. An increase in the mutation rate, therefore,
correlates with the number of mutations that accumulate. Such an increase in mutation rate is referred to as genome instability.
