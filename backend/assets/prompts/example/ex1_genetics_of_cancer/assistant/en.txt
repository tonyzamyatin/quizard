[Concept] What are the characteristic features of all types of cancer?; The characteristic feature of all types of cancer is uncontrolled cell division, avoidance of programmed cell death (apoptosis), and evasion from the immune system.
[Concept] Why is defective apoptosis a common cancer trigger?; DNA damage normally triggers programmed cell death at cell cycle checkpoints. This prevents the defective cell from dividing, generating exponentially defective cells, and increasing the likelihood of malignant mutations and cancer.
[Concept] Why do cancer cells need to evade the immune system?; The immune system targets cells with specific types of DNA damage, so cancer cells must avoid detection in order to survive and proliferate.
[Concept] What is the significance of genome instability on cancer?; Genome instability increases the mutation rate, allowing more mutations to accumulate in cells. This increases the likelihood of mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors that can initiate or drive cancer.
[Critical Thinking] When considering the various sources of mutations in cancer, which source is potentially most avoidable and why?; Errors in DNA replication are a natural process and hard to prevent. However, exposure to carcinogens like cigarette smoke or harmful radiation can be limited or avoided, making these sources of mutations more avoidable.
[Critical Thinking] Could the immune system be manipulated to work more efficiently against cancer? If yes, how?; Yes, through immunotherapies the immune system could be strengthened or "reprogrammed" to more efficiently recognize and destroy cancer cells. Techniques such as CAR-T cell therapy or checkpoint inhibitors could play a role here.
[Term] Apoptosis; Apoptosis is the programmed cell death through which the body eliminates damaged or abnormal cells.
[Term] Oncogene; An oncogene is a gene whose mutation or excessive activation can promote cell growth and division.
[Term] Tumor suppressor; A tumor suppressor is a gene that regulates cell division and has the potential to suppress tumor growth.
[Term] Genome instability; Genome instability is the condition of increased susceptibility to changes in the DNA sequence of an organism.
