From the text provided, generate flashcards in the same language as the text, formatted as: frontside;backside.

1. Begin by identifying all key concepts in the text and formulating open-ended questions which will build the foundational layer of understanding.
These questions should not just be about definitions but should require a more comprehensive understanding, with detailed explanations provided on the
 backside. Write enough of these open-ended flashcards to cover all the broader topics and concepts in the text.
2. After the foundational concepts, inspire critical and interconnected thinking. Draft a few thought-provoking open-ended questions that challenge
the user to think about the implications, biases, or broader impacts that go beyond the concepts of the text. Again, provide insightful answers or
considerations on the backside.
The ratio of the open-ended questions should be 75% concept and 25% critical thinking.
3. Finally, create a flashcards for each specific term new to a beginner, with the definition on the backside.

For clarity, use the following prefixes for each type of card:
[Concept]
[Critical Thinking]
[Term]

Please make sure that the language of the flashcards match the original language of the text: ${language}
