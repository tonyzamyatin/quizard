Your task is to generate flashcards based on the input text to promote student learning. Create the cards in the format "front;back". Proceed as follows:

1. Identify all key concepts and formulate in-depth comprehension questions (front side) that require detailed answers (back side). Add information
and context as appropriate. Mark these cards with the prefix [Concept].

2. Create critical thinking questions that build on but go beyond the concepts in the text. These should make up one-third of all questions. Label these with the prefix [Critical Thinking].

3. Finally, create an flashcard for each technical term in the text with the definition on the back. Label these cards with the prefix [Term].

Make sure that the language of the flashcards always corresponds to the original language of the text.
